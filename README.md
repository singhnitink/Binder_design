# De Novo Mini Binder Design Against PD-L1

This repository documents an end-to-end computational protein design workflow for de novo mini binder generation against human PD-L1.

The project uses a modern protein design pipeline:

```text
Target preparation → RFdiffusion → ProteinMPNN → ESMFold validation → analysis/filtering → interaction/MD analysis
```

The purpose of this repository is not to claim experimentally validated binders. It is a practical workflow project: building direct fluency with computational protein design tools from the perspective of an experimental protein engineer.

## Project Goals

This project has three main goals:

1. Build hands-on fluency with modern AI-assisted protein design tools.
2. Understand how parameter choices affect RFdiffusion and downstream design quality.
3. Develop a practical analysis framework for triaging computational designs before experimental testing.

## Scientific Context

PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint ligand that binds PD-1 and suppresses T-cell activation. The PD-1/PD-L1 interaction is a major therapeutic target in oncology.

In this project, PD-L1 is used as a realistic benchmark target because:

- High-resolution structures are available.
- The PD-1 binding interface is well characterized.
- De novo binder design against PD-L1 has been demonstrated in published work.
- The target provides a meaningful biological and therapeutic context for evaluating computational design workflows.

## Important Caveat

The designs in this repository are computational candidates only.

Passing the in silico filters means that a designed sequence is predicted to fold into a structure similar to the intended RFdiffusion backbone. It does **not** mean that the protein binds PD-L1.

Experimental validation would require gene synthesis, protein expression, purification, and binding/biophysical assays such as SPR, BLI, ELISA, SEC, DLS, or thermal stability measurements.

### `notebooks/`

Contains the main computational workflow notebooks.

Current workflow notebooks:

- `01_target_preparation.ipynb`  
  Prepares the PD-L1 target structure and identifies interface/hotspot residues.

- `02_rfdiffusion_binder_generation_clean.ipynb`  
  Generates de novo binder backbones using RFdiffusion.

- `03_proteinmpnn_sequence_design.ipynb`  
  Designs amino acid sequences for generated backbones using ProteinMPNN.

- `04_esmfold_validation_clean.ipynb`  
  Predicts structures from designed sequences and compares them to intended backbones.

- `05_analysis_and_filtering.ipynb`  
  Merges design metrics, ranks candidates, and applies structural filters.

Some workflows are intended for Google Colab, especially GPU-dependent steps. Local notebooks are mainly used for organization, analysis, and portfolio preparation.

### `scripts/`

Contains reusable scripts extracted from notebook workflows.

Example:

- `portfolio_page3_extract_passed_structures_for_viewer.py`  
  Extracts selected structures for downstream visualization in the portfolio project.

## Code / Data Operating Workflow


### Running compute in Colab

Colab should pull code from GitHub rather than acting as the source of truth.

Typical Colab pattern:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

```bash
!git clone https://github.com/singhnitink/Binder_design.git /content/Binder_design
%cd /content/Binder_design
```

Large outputs produced in Colab should be saved temporarily to Google Drive, then copied back to the local Mac project folder if they need to be preserved.

## Key Analysis Concepts

### Structural validation

Designed sequences are evaluated by predicting their structures from sequence alone and comparing those predictions to the intended design backbones.

Primary filters:

- Mean pLDDT > 80
- Cα RMSD to designed backbone < 2.0 Å

Passing these filters indicates fold recapitulation, not target binding.

### ProteinMPNN entropy analysis

ProteinMPNN sequence sampling can identify positions where the model is highly confident versus positions where multiple amino acids appear tolerated.

This can inform experimental library design:

- low-entropy positions → fix
- high-entropy positions → diversify

The goal is to compress library size while enriching for sequences that are more likely to fold and remain compatible with the designed scaffold.

### Parameter sensitivity

The project also explores how RFdiffusion settings affect output quality. The practical goal is to understand how to tune design parameters to get more useful candidates from limited compute.

### Interaction fingerprinting and MD-style analysis

Selected designs are being examined for interaction patterns, side-chain contacts, aromatic stacking, contact persistence, and short-timescale structural behavior.

These analyses are exploratory and are intended to illustrate how computationally selected candidates can be further triaged before experimental testing.

## Tools Used

- RFdiffusion — de novo backbone generation
- ProteinMPNN — inverse folding / sequence design
- ESMFold — sequence-based structure prediction
- BioPython — structure parsing and analysis
- VMD — structure visualization
- OpenMM — molecular simulation exploration
- Python / Jupyter / Google Colab


---

## Reproducibility Notes

Some workflows depend on Google Colab GPU availability and external model repositories. Large model weights and generated bulk outputs are not intended to be tracked directly in this repository.

Recommended practice:

- keep code, notebooks, configs, and curated small outputs in GitHub
- keep local data and generated results in `data/`, which is ignored by Git
- use Google Drive only as temporary Colab staging
- clear notebook outputs before committing when possible
